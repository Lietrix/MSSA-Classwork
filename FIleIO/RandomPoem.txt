If I’d only turned that corner…
or if you’d crossed that street…
if you hadn’t booked that sauna…
How come we didn’t meet?

If I’d joined the Belgian army,
or enrolled at Kansas State,
or if I’d passed on that pastrami…
so – is it now too late? 

If I linger in DeSoto’s,
or step out, some freezing night:
if I stop to take some photos…
who knows?  We might.  We might!

Or must I say, no way, “me rindo”?
Or keep hoping for that glance?
If I gaze in Macy’s window,
will you jostle me, by chance?

So, will you stroll along Delancey
just by the Pitt Street turning?
Or are you, darling, just a fancy,
a figment of my yearning?
